# Summary

...

# Global description 

Annotation plays a key role in the creation of reference datasets that are useful to evaluate medical image processing algorithms and to train machine learning based architectures. `RVXLiverSegmentation` is a 3D Slicer [@3DSlicer2020-Web;@Kikinis2014-3DSlicer] plug-in aimed at speeding-up the annotation of liver anatomy from medical images (CT scans or MRI for intance). This plug-in is decomposed into 4 main tabs:

* loading and managing medical imaging data;
* liver segmentation;
* vessels annotation and segmentation;
* tumor segmentation.
